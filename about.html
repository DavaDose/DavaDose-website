            I had done Bsc nonMed with CS from Gurugram University
             and Diploma Pharmacy from Gurugram Global College of Pharmacy.</p>
            <p>I used my Computer science and Pharmacy knowledge and made this "DavaDose" website to help those students who start their preperations just before exams, as a student even i had seen many students around me who had not studied for the whole year and in the last moment just wanted short notes in easy language to understand and memorise in less time.  </p>
        <p>Here you get both types of notes deep & detailed as well as short notes. Crash courses for D.pharmacy yearly exams and for Exit Exam are also available on our site.</p>
